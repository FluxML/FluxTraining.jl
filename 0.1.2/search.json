Once you have a  Learner , the simplest way to start training is to run  fit! (learner, n) .  This will train for  n  epochs of one training phase and one validation phase each . Like the  callback system , the training loop has an extensible interface based on multiple dispatch . The key abstraction are  Phase s .  In fact, the above  fit!(learner, n)  is just a shorthand for running  fit!(learner, [TrainingPhase(), ValidationPhase()])   n  times . Each phase implements its own training logic which is run when calling  fit!(learner, phase) : TrainingPhase  does what you expect it to: it uses the training data iterator ( learner.data.training ), iterates over the batches, computes the forward and backward pass for each batch and updates the model parameters . ValidationPhase  uses the validation data to compute the forward pass If this looks like a regular old training loop, you ’ re right !
