    stateaccess(callback)

Return a named tuple determining what learner state `callback`
can access.

The default is `(;)`, the empty named tuple, meaning no state can be accessed.

Implementations of `stateaccess` should always return the least permissions
possible.

For example, the [`ToGPU`](#) callback needs to write both the model and the batch data,
so its `stateaccess` implementation is:

```julia
stateaccess(::ToGPU) = (
    model = Write(),
    params = Write(),
    batch = (xs = Write(), ys = Write()),
)
```

Be careful when defining `stateaccess` that you do return a `NamedTuple`. `(x = Read(),)` is
one but `(x = Read())` (without the comma) is parsed as an assignment with value `Read()`.

To implement, dispatch on the callback types that you which to resolve (in any
order) and return one of the following:

- [`Unresolvable`](#)`()` if the callbacks must not be used together
- [`RunFirst`](#)`(cb)` if one of the callbacks needs to run first; or
