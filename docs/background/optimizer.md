# Optimizers

An optimizer takes the calculated gradients from a training step and uses them to update the parameters of a [model](/doc/docs/background/model.md). FluxTraining.jl currently only supports optimizers from [Flux.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl).

A complete reference of optimizers in Flux.jl can be found [here](https://fluxml.ai/Flux.jl/stable/training/optimisers/).
